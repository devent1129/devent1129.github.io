<h2>Tip
	<br>
Turn it breast side down with the legs toward you and, using sturdy kitchen scissors, cut along either side of the backbone and remove it. Open the bird out and turn it over so you can flatten it.</h2>


<h3>Instructions:</h3>

<p>To make the marinade, place a small saucepan over medium heat and add the olive oil. Once hot, saut√© the onion with a pinch of salt for five minutes, or until softened.
<br>
<br>
Add the garlic and continue to cook for one minute, then add the remaining marinade ingredients. Stir well and simmer gently for five to six minutes. Taste and adjust the seasoning as necessary, adding more soy sauce for a more savory flavor. Leave to cool.
<br>
<br>
When the marinade has cooled down, put the Cornish game hens into a container and pour over the marinade. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and put it into the fridge for at least an hour, or up to 2 days.
<br>
<br>
When ready to cook, light the grill or preheat the oven to 350 degrees and remove the birds from the fridge to let them come to room temperature.
<br>
<br>
To barbecue, when the coals are medium-hot, put the birds on the grill for 20 minutes, or until cooked through, turning after 10 minutes.
<br>
<br>
To oven-cook, put the marinated hens on a roasting sheet, breast side up, and into the oven. Roast for 30 to 35 minutes, until cooked through, basting occasionally. (If the extremities of the birds look like they might burn, cover with a piece of aluminum foil for the remainder of the cooking time.)</p>

<p>Meanwhile, heat a grill pan or grill until very hot and cook the corn on all sides until lightly charred. This will take 7 to 10 minutes. (To barbecue the corn, place the cobs on the grill before the chicken while the coals are still very hot.)
<br>
<br>
While the corn is cooking, put the lime juice, chipotle paste, maple syrup, olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper into a jar with a tight-fitting lid and shake until combined.
<br>
<br>
Remove the kernels from the cobs by placing the cobs on their ends on a cutting board and running a sharp knife along the cobs. Put the kernels into a large mixing bowl.
<br>
<br>
Add the red pepper, red onion, cilantro stems and beans and pour in the dressing. Toss well to make sure everything is coated, then taste and adjust the seasoning as necessary.
<br>
<br>
Once the birds are cooked, remove from the oven and leave to rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Sprinkle with the cilantro leaves and serve with the corn salad and lots of napkins!</p>
