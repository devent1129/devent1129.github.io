    <div class="intro">You may know the fiery Gordon Ramsay from his reality TV cooking show, "Hell's Kitchen," where he turns up the heat on contestants.

Off camera, he's a fitness fanatic and health-conscious eater and now he's sharing a collection of his healthy recipes that don't compromise on flavor in his new cookbook, "Healthy Lean & Fit."

Home cooks Shannon Odom and Loc Vu were selected to prepare two of Ramsay's dishes in front of the star chef. After tasting them side by side, Ramsay chose Odom's take on his "fried" chicken sandwich as the winning dish.

He also presented her with a trip to Las Vegas where she will visit two of the Michellin-starred chef's restaurants.

Ramsay believes eating well is important, whether it's for training or just trying to live healthier.
His cookbook collects 108 recipes which take different health-boosting benefits into account from nourishment and weight loss to pre- and post-workout dishes that build strength and energy.</div>
