    <div class="intro">You may know the fiery Gordon Ramsay from his reality TV cooking show, "Hell's Kitchen," where he turns up the heat on contestants.

Off camera, he's a fitness fanatic and health-conscious eater and now he's sharing a collection of his healthy recipes that don't compromise on flavor in his new cookbook, "Healthy Lean & Fit."

Ramsay believes eating well is important, whether it's for training or just trying to live healthier.
His cookbook collects 108 recipes which take different health-boosting benefits into account from nourishment and weight loss to pre- and post-workout dishes that build strength and energy.</div>
