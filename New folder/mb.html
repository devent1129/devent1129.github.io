  		<ul>
			<li>4 large courgettes, trimmed</li>
			<li>Olive oil, for frying</li>
			<li>Grated Parmesan cheese, to serve (optional)</li></ul></p>
	<h3>For meatballs</h3>
	<p>	<ul>
			<li>500g lean turkey mince</li>
			<li>1 small onion, peeled and very finely chopped</li>
			<li>2 garlic cloves, peeled and very finely chopped</li>
			<li>2 tsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
			<li>1 egg, beaten</li>
			<li>Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</li></ul></p>
	<h3>For Tomatoes Sauce</h3>
	<p><ul>
			<li>Olive oil, for frying</li>
			<li>1 onion, peeled and diced</li>
			<li>2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed</li>
			<li>1 tbsp tomato purée</li>
			<li>2 x 400g tins chopped tomatoes</li>
			<li>½ tsp dried oregano</li>
			<li>½ tsp balsamic vinegar</li></ul></p>
			<h3>Cooking Instructions</h3>
			<p>Using a spiralizer, julienne peeler or mandolin, turn the 4 courgettes into spaghetti. Put to one side until ready to cook.
				<br>
				<br>
Put the turkey mince into a mixing bowl with the chopped onion, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, beaten egg and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Mix everything together until thoroughly combined.
				<br>
				<br>
With wet hands, roll the mixture into 20 meatballs and put them on to a plate. Cover with cling film and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes.
<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, make the tomato sauce. Place a large frying pan over a medium heat and add a dash of olive oil. Once hot, add the onion and sauté for 5–6 minutes until soft, then add the garlic and cook for a further minute.
<br>
<br>
Stir in the tomato purée and continue to cook for 2 minutes, then add the chopped tomatoes, oregano, balsamic vinegar and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Stir everything together and leave to simmer for 10 minutes, until slightly thickened.
<br>
<br>
To cook the meatballs, place a frying pan over a medium heat and add a dash of oil. Once hot, brown the meatballs in batches, turning frequently so they colour on all sides. Transfer to the pan with the tomato sauce to cook for a further 10 minutes until cooked through, turning from time to time. (If the sauce becomes too thick, add 50–100ml of water.)
<br>
<br>
Add an extra teaspoon of oil to the frying pan the meatballs were browned in and gently sauté the courgette spaghetti over a medium heat, tossing occasionally, for 3–5 minutes, until soft but with a slight bite.
<br>
<br>
Divide the courgette spaghetti between serving bowls and top with the meatballs. Sprinkle with Parmesan, if using.</p>
